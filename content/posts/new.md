Hi everyone,

First, let me introduce myself. I'm PK. I'm a developer. I enjoy making websites and apps, as well as computer games.
At the moment, I'm learning Javascript because I want to work with ReactJS. It will probably be a month until I get the hang of it.

I've decided to start a blog because I have so many ideas and I don't want to write it down on a piece of paper
or google drive. This blog will be about life, business, entrepreneurship, marketing, mindset, and programming.
