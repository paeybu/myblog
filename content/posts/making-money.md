I need the money, what do I do?

Here is my list of ideas

- Make website for clients
- Get a job as a front end dev
- Make JS game for Koji
- Create web dev course
- Compile tools and assets for developers to make website really fast
- Create YT channel

Here are the problems or requirements for each one

**Make website for clients**  
**Pros**: Easy money. 10k + / sites within a day or two using wordpress or SSG  
**Cons**: Need to market and sales
Need fo find clients. Learn sales. Make demo sites for businesses.

**Get a job as a front end dev**  
**Pros**: Good money, starts at around 40-50k / yr  
      Gain valueable skills, collaboration  
**Cons**: Work for others
Need to be pro at JS (working on it) and React (need to learn all JS thingy first)

**Make JS game for koji**  
**Pros**: Very enjoyable  
**Cons**: Game programming is quite hard, not really familiar with it
Koji gives you 15k / game but you need to integrate the koji thingy

**Create web dev course**  
**Pros**: Very good money, nearly passive income  
**Cons**: Very time consuming, need to do sales and marketing
Good idea, will come back when I'm very good

**Compile tools and assets for developers to make website really fast**  
**Pros**: Very valueable, easy to market and sell  
**Cons**: Graphic dependent
I like this. Very easy to make money because the value is really high and they will breakeven in less than 1 client

I think I'm going to go with Making JS game because I'll probably get pay fast. Anyway, 
I'd probably end up doing all of them anyway. So here are my steps that I need to do.

1. Finish Javascript.info course, meanwhile, learn game programming with JS
2. Finish Javascript30 challenge
3. Learn ReactJS and Redux thoroughly
4. Make portfolio like shitloads of them. Like 1 a day or more
5. Profit?
6. Move on to full stack or business, depending on what happens then
