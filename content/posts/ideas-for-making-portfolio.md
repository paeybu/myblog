Need to expand your portfolio but you don't have any clients? Easy.

Make something up.

Make what? Make a website, make an app, anything. If you need content, just google some random shit and use that as a website. Need a picture place holder?  
https://picsum.photos  
https://loremflickr.com  
https://placekitten.com
Need some random text content?  
https://randomwordgenerator.com/sentence.php

Or google some local business (even abroad, who cares) and make a demo site. When you're done, you can even email them and ask if they are interested or not. You have nothing to lose.  
You started from nothing, if they deny it or doesn't respond, you are back with one more project added to your portfolio.

Need idea for design?
Go on behance or themeforest and copy copy until you can do all of them on your own
